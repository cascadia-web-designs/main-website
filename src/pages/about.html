        Cascadia Web Designs is a professional web design agency dedicated to creating beautiful and ultra-fast websites for businesses, small or large. We believe that a website is more than just an online presence - it's a powerful marketing tool that can help businesses connect with their target audience, increase sales and ultimately building creditibility. 
      </p>
      <p class="cs-text">
        The acceleration of technology has created an unfair gap between those with an online presence and those without. We have found the markup for creating new websites from other competitiors can be quite steep, and often times their services leaves a lot to be desired. With many small business owners understanding that the crux of their business is having multiple streams of advertisement, many often forgo the creation of a website or using unreiliable alternatives such as Wordpress. That's how we settled on a model that can work for anyone with flat rates at $200 a month and $0 down. <b>No joke</b>.
