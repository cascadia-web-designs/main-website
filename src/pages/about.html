      <p class="cs-text">
        We are a locally owned business based in Vancouver, Washington. Our goal is to help businesses of all sizes build a strong online presence through beautifully designed websites that follow of the logic of being Mobile First. Founded by two friends who met in Vancouver, they thought that being a small business owner in the digital age is tough without experience. With knowledge of an Ex-Amazon Employee and a sharp eye for design, we set off with a mission to change that.
      </p>
      <p class="cs-text">
        With flat rates on websites being marked up to astronomical prices, it is difficult for many small businesses to realistically afford those services. Because of that, we made it a mission to help local communities and small buisnesses owner's create something that won't thousands of dollars. Yet still deliver quality, SEO tested websites that will boost digital traffic for any business.
